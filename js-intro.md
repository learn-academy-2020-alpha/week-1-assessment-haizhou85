# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: function is codes to let program do certain work.

  Researched answer: function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. 



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: map gives a new array, changes all the values. filter gives a new selected array.  

  Researched answer: filter returns a subset of the elements from the original array, it creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function. map produces an array with new, different entries based on the elements in the original array.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() logs a value that is only be seen by the programer, Return ends the function and put a value to the function.

  Researched answer: console.log() displays the parameter passed to the log method in the console window. Return stops the function from executing, and returns a specific value to the function.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: variables we want to take into the function.

  Researched answer: Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair progamming is two people coding together, one driver writes the code, one navigator reviews the code, and gives advices. The two role switches frequently.

  Researched answer: pair programming is where two developers work using only one machine. One programmer acts as the driver who codes while the other will serve as the observer who will check the code being written, proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD is test driven development. Write the test first, run tests, write new code to pass tests, then run tests and repeat.

  Researched answer: TDD is a software development approach where tests are written, before writing minimum of code required for the test to be fulfilled. The code will then be refactored, as often as necessary, in order to pass the test, with the process being repeated for each piece of functionality. The work flow of TDD is:
    1.Write test
    2.Run test
    3.Check for failed tests
    4.Make changes to the code
    5.Repeat from step 2



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: random pairing, check-in and check-out.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React

When the state object changes, the component re-renders.


- CRUD

- this

it is the keyword refers to the object it belongs to.
